<h3>COMP1950 Redesign - Rationale</h3>
<h3>Classification of information </h3>
<p>We felt there was no need to provide an ability to constantly change the course content, since it is fairly stable.   So a fairly static site is how we would create a redesigned site.</p>
<p>The amount of content in the current site is sufficient. Most of the information that the students need is already there. Below are some things that we thought can help make it easier for the students to navigate through the site. </p>
<h3>Font and Color </h3>
<p>The font and colors of the current site were maintained. They are easy to read and the contrast of colors makes it easier to for the students to identify the different elements—headers, body and sample code. Furthermore, the color scheme already employed by the current COMP1950 site carries the “branding” that Alistair has already developed.   </p>
<h3>Main Page </h3>
<p>The main page would contain the basic information about the course.  It should have a short description of COMP 1950, the important dates and course requirements, and information about the instructor. </p>
<p>A navigation bar that links to the Main, News, Discussion, and Feedback pages was created so that these pages can be accessed easily from anywhere in the website. </p>
<p>A side bar containing the different lectures will also be added since the lectures are the most important information in the website. </p>
<p>The intention of the footer is to allow the user to both send e-mail to the instructor, and provide a brief introduction about the instructor. The Twitter, Facebook, and discussion forum buttons are also added to provide quick access to their respective social media pages. It was created as a “social hub” where the student can interact with the instructor and each other. The feedback box must provide adequate amount of space for the user to compose a detailed e-mail and hence, requires a large area of the screen. To slim down the interface, we decided to hide the footer and present it to the user when “CONTACT” at the bottom of the page is clicked. </p>
<h3>Lecture Pages </h3>
<p>It would be nice to keep the current classification of lecture notes which is based on the lecture number. This way it will be easier for the instructor to hide notes that students do not need to see yet. It is important to keep the ability to show the content as it is relevant (not displaying lecture material ahead of time). As per Alistair’s comment, attendance would wane if it was available before the class. </p>
<p>The objective of our content and layout redesign is to allow the students to be able to navigate through the lecture material more easily. We sub-classified the lecture notes further based on topics. The inspiration behind this idea came from codeshool.com which divides each course into sub courses. </p>
<p>The accordion menu that we implemented allows going through lecture materials more easily. From either the main page or any part of the lecture pages, the students can easily get to the different topics of each lecture, or homework area.  We used anchors that allow users to easily jump from one major section of the page to another. These anchors are used as links in the accordion menu and are listed according to how they appear in the flow of the course lecture material.   </p>
<p>Lastly, we also added a site search capability to query the contents more easily. This way, the students would not need to skim through all the course materials to find certain information. </p>
<h3>Discussion Page and Feedback Page </h3>
<p>Discussion and homework feedback sections would be useful features that would encourage interaction among the students and the instructor. It will make it easier to share thoughts, ideas, tips, and get feedback on homeworks in one place. It can also serve as a one-stop shopping area, as opposed to now where we have to go into my.bcit.ca for homework feedback.   </p>
<p>There will be an authentication/ sign-in button in the assignment feedback page.  We debated whether authentication for this is needed.  We realize that there is no such functionality on today’s site, but we believe it is necessary in order to have some control over who can and cannot post. </p>
<h3>News/Tumblr Page </h3>
<p>The Tumblr page is designed to allow the instructor to post relevant news quickly and concisely. Typically, the title is displayed on the left while the content is displayed on the right for each post. We’ve decided to support texts, images, videos, and quotes because we believe that these post types are most relevant to instructor and student interaction. Texts are needed to explain any news update. Pictures can be posted for any graphical description of concepts explained in class. Relevant tutorial videos can be posted to provide students with more background information or practical examples. And quotes are supported to allow the instructor to inspire the young pupils with clever and philosophical statements. It was also designed around the standard page layout of the lecture, discussion and homepage so the user can browse Tumblr news and return to the homepage seamlessly. </p>

<p>Requirements
The COMP 1950 owner (Alistair Calder) would like the web site redesigned in order to better meet the needs of students. The website owner has contracted your group, as students of the class, to act as contractors for this project

Project Goals

    Students must have easy access to notes, examples and other information
    The site should reflect the aims of the course: Standards compliant web development, CSS, HTML, Methodology-driven design, etc
    Think outside the box - don’t just copy the current design. Look around at other sites and use your creativity. But - be realistic! Make your suggestions something that can work
    If you have questions that will further refine your own direction, ask the owner of the site for details Think about this project in context of the Methodology discussion that happened in class and the readings for week 8

Deliverables

For this project, you have been contracted to provide a protosite and supporting documents for the proposed website Your deliverables are going to be:

    A web site created for this project that describes the project (similar to this example sitemap) and links to various artifacts. This is generally known as a meta site.
    An Introduction page that describes the project and the members of the team. This page should also list what each team member actually did during the project
    A proto-site that has at least three of the main pages mocked up. The home page, a lecture page and a blog page are required, others as necessary.
    The blog page can either be news, or a blog or whatever you think would make for timely news. You must use Tumblr for this, and make your template match whatever you come up with for the rest of the site.
    Wireframe(s) of the major sections of the site (Example lecture page) that you used to design the protosite (done in HTML, Word or Visio). These can also be done by using paper prototypes (scanned) or just using a low-tech solution like Word (make boxes in Drawing mode) or HTML (using simple tables)
    Include descriptions of what is included in each content area
    Sitemap (Example sitemap) (HTML, Word or Visio)
    Rationale page - this is the most important page in your site. This is where you describe why you chose to build the site in the way you have proposed. Make sure you agreee on this in your group!
    All of this should be presented in an HTML compliant web site with CSS-based Navigation

Teamwork

This project will require work from all members of your team!

    All content must be valid HTML5
